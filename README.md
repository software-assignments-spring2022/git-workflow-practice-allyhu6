I find it interesting how the progression of tech hubs has changed from the late 1900s to now and how different incentives that communities and cities give to become such hubs can have drastic impacts on the communities around them. Equity takes time, resources and planning and so because Silicon Valley is so unregulated, it is unlikely to make the changes people want to see in a tech workplace(like gender equality, better funding, racial diversity). We should look towards the next "Silicon Valley" for better planning.
